## Troubleshooting Methodology üîé
A structured approach to identify, diagnose, and resolve network issues efficiently.

### Key Concepts
1. **Identify the Problem**:
   - Gather symptoms and user reports.
   - **Example**: User reports inability to access a website.
   - **Details**: Document specific errors (e.g., ‚Äúpage not found‚Äù) or performance issues.
2. **Establish a Theory**:
   - Hypothesize potential causes based on symptoms.
   - **Example**: Suspecting a DNS resolution issue for website access failure.
   - **Details**: Consider common issues like connectivity, configuration, or hardware.
3. **Test the Theory**:
   - Use diagnostic tools to verify the hypothesis.
   - **Example**: Pinging the website‚Äôs IP to bypass DNS and test connectivity.
   - **Details**: Tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, or Wireshark help confirm theories.
4. **Plan and Implement a Solution**:
   - Develop and apply a fix with a rollback plan.
   - **Example**: Updating DNS server settings on a client device.
   - **Details**: Test in a controlled environment if possible to avoid disruptions.
5. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Confirm the fix resolves the issue and restores full functionality.
   - **Example**: Testing website access after DNS fix.
   - **Details**: Check related systems to ensure no new issues arise.
6. **Document Findings**:
   - Record the issue, cause, and solution for future reference.
   - **Example**: Logging the DNS fix in a ticketing system like Jira.
   - **Details**: Includes timestamps, actions, and outcomes for audits.

### Real-World Example
A user can‚Äôt access a website due to a misconfigured DNS server. The admin identifies the issue, tests by pinging the IP directly, updates the DNS settings, verifies access, and documents the solution, similar to a postal worker correcting a misrouted package by updating the address.

### Homelab Activity: Practice Troubleshooting Methodology
- **Tool**: Cisco Packet Tracer (free at skillsforall.com).
- **Objective**: Troubleshoot a connectivity issue using the methodology.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a network in Packet Tracer with one router, one switch, and two PCs.
  2. Assign IPs: PC1 (192.168.1.2/24), PC2 (192.168.1.3/24), router (192.168.1.1/24).
  3. Intentionally misconfigure PC1‚Äôs default gateway (e.g., set to 192.168.1.2 instead of 192.168.1.1).
  4. Attempt to ping PC2 from PC1 (should fail).
  5. Follow the methodology:
     - **Identify**: No connectivity between PCs.
     - **Theorize**: Incorrect gateway on PC1.
     - **Test**: Check PC1‚Äôs configuration with `ipconfig` in Packet Tracer‚Äôs CLI.
     - **Fix**: Set correct gateway (192.168.1.1) on PC1.
     - **Verify**: Ping PC2 from PC1 (should succeed).
     - **Document**: Note issue and fix in a text file (e.g., ‚ÄúMisconfigured gateway, corrected to 192.168.1.1‚Äù).
  6. Save the Packet Tracer file for reference.
- **Why It Matters**: Reinforces systematic troubleshooting, a core skill for PBQs and real-world network administration.

### Quiz

    - **Example**: Miswired RJ45 connector causing connectivity issues.
    - **Details**: Follow T568-B standard (orange-white, orange, green-white, blue, blue-white, green, brown-white, brown).
  - **TX/RX Transposed**: Incorrect transmit/receive pairs in cabling.
    - **Example**: Using a straight-through cable when a crossover is needed.
    - **Details**: Modern devices with Auto-MDIX often auto-correct this.
- **Interface Issues**:
  - **Increasing Counters**: Rising error or discard counts on interfaces.
    - **Example**: High CRC errors on a switch port indicating cabling issues.
    - **Details**: Check with `show interface` to identify errors like CRC or collisions.
  - **Port Status**: Ports that are down or administratively disabled.
    - **Example**: Switch port disabled, preventing connectivity.
    - **Details**: Verify with `show interface status` or `show running-config`.
- **Hardware Issues**:
  - **PoE (Power over Ethernet)**: Insufficient power for devices.
    - **Example**: Access point not powering up due to inadequate PoE.
    - **Details**: Ensure switch supports 802.3af (15.4W) or 802.3at (30W).
  - **Transceiver Mismatch**: Incompatible transceivers for ports.
    - **Example**: Using a 1 Gbps SFP in a 10 Gbps port.
    - **Details**: Check transceiver compatibility with device specifications.
  - **Signal Strength**: Weak signals, especially in wireless setups.

  3. Attempt to ping PC2 from PC1 (should fail).
  4. Check port status on the switch: `show interface FastEthernet0/1` (shows ‚Äúdown‚Äù).
  5. ‚ÄúReconnect‚Äù the cable by enabling the port (`interface FastEthernet0/1`, `no shutdown`) or replacing the cable in simulation.
  6. Verify connectivity with `ping` from PC1 to PC2.
  7. (Optional) If available, use a physical cable tester on an Ethernet cable to check continuity and T568-B wiring.
  8. Document findings (e.g., ‚ÄúPort down due to cable issue, fixed by enabling port‚Äù).
- **Why It Matters**: Teaches physical layer troubleshooting, a common PBQ scenario and real-world skill.

    - **Details**: Check with `ip default-gateway` or `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0`.
- **Address Pool Exhaustion**:
  - DHCP pool runs out of IP addresses.
  - **Example**: New devices receive APIPA (169.254.x.x) due to depleted pool.
  - **Details**: Expand pool or reduce lease duration (`ip dhcp pool`).
- **Incorrect Gateway/IP/Subnet Mask**:
  - Misconfigured client or device settings.
  - **Example**: Wrong subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.0.0 instead of 255.255.255.0) preventing communication.
  - **Details**: Verify with `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux).

### Real-World Example

     - `network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0`
     - `default-router 192.168.1.1`
     - Limit pool: `ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.254`
  3. Set PCs to obtain IPs via DHCP; the third PC should get an APIPA address (169.254.x.x).
  4. Fix the issue: Remove the excluded range (`no ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.254`).
  5. Verify the third PC gets a valid IP with `ipconfig`.
  6. Document the issue and fix (e.g., ‚ÄúDHCP pool exhausted, expanded range‚Äù).
- **Why It Matters**: Teaches DHCP troubleshooting, a frequent PBQ and real-world scenario.

### Quiz
1. What causes address pool exhaustion?  
   **Answer**: Depleted DHCP IP address pool.  
2. How do you verify VLAN assignments?  
   **Answer**: Use `show vlan brief`.  
3. What indicates a missing route?  
   **Answer**: No connectivity to a remote network, check with `show ip route`.

- **Broadcast Storms**:
  - **Cause**: Network loops or misconfigured devices.
  - **Solution**: Enable STP, check for redundant links.
  - **Example**: Network slows due to loop; enable STP to block redundant path.

### Real-World Example
A website fails to load due to a DNS issue. Setting the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 and flushing the cache resolves it, like updating a postal address database to ensure correct delivery.

### Homelab Activity: Troubleshoot DNS Issue

  6. On your home network, use NetSpot to scan for Wi-Fi channels and identify overlap; adjust your router to a non-overlapping channel (1, 6, or 11).
  7. Document findings (e.g., ‚ÄúChannel overlap on 2.4 GHz, set AP2 to channel 6‚Äù).
- **Why It Matters**: Teaches wireless troubleshooting, aligning with Professor Messer‚Äôs wireless troubleshooting video and exam PBQs.

### Quiz
1. What causes a weak Wi-Fi signal?  
   **Answer**: Distance, obstacles, or low-power antennas.
