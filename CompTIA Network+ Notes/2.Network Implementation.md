## 2.1 - Routing Technologies

Routing technologies enable efficient packet forwarding across networks using static and dynamic protocols, address translation, and redundancy mechanisms.

- **Static Routing**: Manually configured routes in the routing table. **Why it matters**: Simple for small, stable networks. **Example**: Setting a default route on a home router. **Use Case**: Small office networks.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatically updates routing tables using protocols. **Why it matters**: Adapts to network changes. **Example**: OSPF rerouting after a link failure. **Use Case**: Enterprise networks.
  - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Routes between autonomous systems (e.g., ISPs). Uses path attributes. **Example**: Internet backbone routing. **Use Case**: ISP connectivity.
  - **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**: Cisco proprietary, fast convergence, uses bandwidth/delay metrics. **Example**: Routing in a corporate campus. **Use Case**: Cisco-based enterprises.
  - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Open standard, uses link-state database for shortest paths. **Example**: Routing in a multi-site company. **Use Case**: Large LANs.
- **Route Selection**: Routers choose the most specific route (longest prefix match) or use metrics (e.g., hop count, bandwidth) and administrative distance (e.g., OSPF: 110, BGP: 20). **Why it matters**: Optimizes packet paths. **Example**: Choosing a 1 Gbps link over a 100 Mbps link. **Use Case**: Multi-path networks.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Translates private IPs (RFC 1918) to public IPs. **Why it matters**: Addresses IPv4 shortage (~4.29 billion addresses). **Example**: Home router sharing one public IP. **Use Case**: Internet access.
- **Port Address Translation (PAT)**: Maps multiple private IPs to one public IP using ports. **Why it matters**: Conserves public IPs. **Example**: Multiple devices sharing a single public IP. **Use Case**: Home networks.
- **First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)**: Provides gateway redundancy (e.g., HSRP, VRRP). Uses a virtual IP (VIP) shared by routers. **Why it matters**: Ensures continuous connectivity. **Example**: HSRP failover to backup router. **Use Case**: High-availability networks.
- **Virtual IP (VIP)**: A shared IP address for FHRP or load balancers. **Why it matters**: Simplifies client access. **Example**: VIP for a cluster of servers. **Use Case**: Load balancing.
- **Subinterfaces**: Logical interfaces on a physical router port, often for VLANs. **Why it matters**: Supports multiple VLANs on one link. **Example**: Router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN routing. **Use Case**: VLAN routing.

## 2.2 - Switching Technologies

Switching technologies manage LAN traffic, segment networks, and prevent loops for efficient data transfer.

- **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**: Logically separate devices into different broadcast domains on a switch. Configured via VLAN database. **Why it matters**: Reduces congestion, enhances security. **Example**: HR and IT on separate VLANs. **Use Case**: Departmental networks.
- **Interface Configuration**: Setting switch ports for access (single VLAN) or trunk (multiple VLANs) modes. Includes speed/duplex settings. **Why it matters**: Optimizes connectivity. **Example**: Configuring port for a PC (access) or switch (trunk). **Use Case**: Office LANs.
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Prevents loops in redundant switch setups (IEEE 802.1D). Uses port states: Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding, Disabled. **Why it matters**: Avoids network crashes. **Example**: Switch disabling a port to prevent a loop. **Use Case**: Redundant LANs.
- **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)**: Maximum packet size (bytes) a device can handle (default: 1500). **Why it matters**: Affects performance. **Example**: Misconfigured MTU causing packet drops. **Use Case**: High-throughput networks.
- **Jumbo Frames**: Larger MTU (e.g., 9000 bytes) for high-bandwidth applications. **Why it matters**: Reduces overhead, increases efficiency. **Example**: Data center server transfers. **Use Case**: Storage networks.
