## Logical Security üîê
Protects data and access through software-based controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

### Key Concepts
- **Encryption**:
  - Secures data to prevent unauthorized access during transit or at rest.
  - **Example**: HTTPS uses TLS to encrypt web traffic.
  - **Details**: Common algorithms include AES (symmetric, fast) and RSA (asymmetric, key exchange).
- **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**:
  - Manages digital certificates for secure communication.
  - **Example**: Issuing an SSL certificate for a company website.
  - **Details**: Relies on a Certificate Authority (CA) to issue, validate, and revoke certificates.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
  - Centralizes user identity and access control.
  - **Example**: Assigning admin roles for IT staff and user roles for employees.
  - **Details**: Often implemented with tools like Active Directory or Okta.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**:
  - Requires multiple verification methods for enhanced security.
  - **Example**: Logging in with a password and a smartphone app code.
  - **Details**: Combines factors like something you know (password), have (token), or are (biometrics).
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)**:
  - Allows one login to access multiple systems.
  - **Example**: Using one set of credentials for email and company apps.
  - **Details**: Reduces password fatigue and simplifies user experience.
- **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)**:
  - Centralizes authentication for network devices.
  - **Example**: Authenticating users on a corporate Wi-Fi network.

  - **Example**: Securing admin access to Cisco routers.
  - **Details**: Separates authentication, authorization, and accounting for granular control.
- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**:
  - Enables secure identity exchange for SSO across systems.
  - **Example**: SSO for cloud apps like Microsoft 365.
  - **Details**: XML-based, supports federated identity across organizations.
- **Time-Based Authentication**:
  - Uses temporary codes that refresh periodically.
  - **Example**: Google Authenticator generating TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password).
  - **Details**: Codes typically refresh every 30 seconds for security.
- **Authorization**:
  - Defines what users can do after authentication.
  - **Example**: Granting read-only access to a database for analysts.
  - **Details**: Controls permissions post-login.
- **Least Privilege**:
  - Grants only the minimum access needed for a task.
  - **Example**: Limiting an employee to specific network resources.
  - **Details**: Reduces the attack surface by minimizing permissions.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
  - Assigns access based on user roles.
  - **Example**: Admin role with full access, guest role with limited access.
  - **Details**: Simplifies management in large organizations.
- **Geofencing**:
  - Restricts access based on geographic location.
  - **Example**: Allowing network access only from the company office.
  - **Details**: Uses GPS, IP, or Wi-Fi-based location checks.

### Real-World Example
A company implements MFA (password + authenticator app) and RBAC to ensure employees access only necessary systems, with encryption securing sensitive data transfers.

### Homelab Activity: Simulate RADIUS-Based MFA
- **Tools**: FreeRADIUS (free at freeradius.org) and Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Objective**: Set up a RADIUS server to simulate MFA for network access.
- **Steps**:
  1. Install FreeRADIUS on a PC or virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu in VirtualBox).
  2. In Packet Tracer, create a network with a router, switch, and PC.
  3. Configure the router for RADIUS:
     - `aaa new-model`
     - `radius-server host <FreeRADIUS_IP> key Secret123`
     - `aaa authentication login default group radius local`
  4. Enable 802.1X on the router: `dot1x system-auth-control`.
  5. Configure FreeRADIUS for username/password and a simulated second factor (e.g., manual token entry in FreeRADIUS config).
  6. Test access from the PC to the router using a username/password combo.
  7. Verify authentication in FreeRADIUS logs (e.g., `/var/log/freeradius/radius.log`).
- **Why It Matters**: Teaches logical security and authentication, critical for exam PBQs and enterprise networks.
