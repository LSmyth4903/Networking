## Routing Technologies üåê
Routing directs data between networks, ensuring packets reach their destination efficiently.

### Key Concepts
- **Static Routing**: Manually configured routes for specific destinations.
  - **Use Case**: Small networks or predictable traffic patterns (e.g., connecting a branch office to headquarters).
  - **Pros**: Simple, no overhead.
  - **Cons**: Not scalable, requires manual updates.
  - **Example Command**: `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1` (sends traffic for 192.168.2.0/24 to next hop 10.0.0.1).
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatically updates routes using protocols.
  - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**:
    - Used for internet-scale routing between autonomous systems (e.g., ISPs).
    - Relies on AS (Autonomous System) paths to determine routes.
    - **Example**: An ISP uses BGP to route traffic across global networks.
  - **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**:
    - Cisco proprietary, uses bandwidth and delay for efficient routing.
    - Fast convergence for large corporate networks.
    - **Example**: Routing between multiple office locations.
  - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**:
    - Link-state protocol for large, scalable networks.
    - Uses Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to calculate shortest paths.
    - Supports areas to organize networks.
    - **Example**: Multi-office enterprise routing.
- **Route Selection**: Routers choose paths based on metrics like cost, hop count, or bandwidth.
  - **Example**: A router prefers a 1 Gbps link over a 100 Mbps link.
- **NAT/PAT (Network Address Translation/Port Address Translation)**:
  - Translates private IPs to public IPs to conserve address space.
  - PAT allows multiple devices to share one public IP using unique ports.
  - **Example**: A home router uses PAT to allow multiple devices to access the internet.
- **FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocol)**:
  - Ensures gateway redundancy (e.g., HSRP, VRRP).
  - Creates a virtual IP for failover.
  - **Example**: If the primary router fails in a data center, HSRP switches to a backup router.
- **VIP (Virtual IP)**:
  - A shared IP address used for redundancy or load balancing.
  - **Example**: Directing traffic to available servers in a cluster.
- **Subinterfaces**:
  - Virtual interfaces on a physical port for VLAN routing.
  - **Example**: Routing VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 traffic on one router port (e.g., `interface g0/0.10`).

### Real-World Example
A company uses OSPF to manage routing between its headquarters and branch offices, with NAT on the edge router to connect private internal IPs to the internet.

### Homelab Activity: Configure Static Routing and NAT
- **Tool**: Cisco Packet Tracer (free, beginner-friendly network simulator).
- **Objective**: Set up a small network with static routing and NAT.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Packet Tracer and add two routers, one switch, and two PCs.
  2. Connect PC1 (192.168.1.2/24) to Router1‚Äôs Gig0/0 and PC2 (192.168.2.2/24) to Router2‚Äôs Gig0/0.
  3. Configure Router1 interfaces:
     - Gig0/0: 192.168.1.1/24 (LAN)
     - Gig0/1: 10.0.0.1/30 (WAN link to Router2)
  4. Configure Router2 interfaces:
     - Gig0/0: 192.168.2.1/24 (LAN)
     - Gig0/1: 10.0.0.2/30 (WAN link to Router1)
  5. Add a static route on Router1: `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`.
  6. Configure NAT on Router1 (for internet simulation):
     - `access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255`
     - `ip nat inside source list 1 interface Gig0/1 overload`
     - Set Gig0/0 as `ip nat inside` and Gig0/1 as `ip nat outside`.
  7. From PC1, ping PC2 (192.168.2.2) to verify connectivity.
- **Why It Matters**: This lab mimics real-world routing and NAT setups, preparing you for Performance-Based Questions (PBQs) on the exam.

## Switching Technologies üîå
Switches connect devices within a network, forwarding frames based on MAC addresses.

### Key Concepts
- **VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)**:
  - Logically separate networks without additional hardware.
  - **Use Case**: Isolating employee and guest devices in an office.
  - **Configuration**: `vlan 10` (creates VLAN 10), `switchport access vlan 10` (assigns a port).
- **Interface Configuration**:
  - Sets port parameters like speed (e.g., 1 Gbps) or duplex (full/half).
  - **Example**: `speed 1000`, `duplex full` for a high-speed connection.
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**:
  - Prevents switching loops in redundant topologies.
  - Elects a root bridge and blocks alternate paths.
  - **Example**: Two switches with redundant links use STP to block one path.
- **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) and Jumbo Frames**:
  - Standard MTU is 1500 bytes; jumbo frames (e.g., 9000 bytes) support high-bandwidth applications like video streaming.
  - **Example**: Configuring `mtu 9000` for a server-to-server link.

### Real-World Example
A corporate switch uses VLAN 10 for employees and VLAN 20 for guests, with STP ensuring no loops form between redundant switch connections.

### Homelab Activity: Configure VLANs and STP
- **Tool**: Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Objective**: Create VLANs and verify STP operation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Add two switches and four PCs in Packet Tracer.
  2. On Switch1, create VLANs: `vlan 10`, `vlan 20`.
  3. Assign ports:
     - PC1 and PC2 to VLAN 10: `switchport access vlan 10` (ports FastEthernet0/1, 0/2).
     - PC3 and PC4 to VLAN 20: `switchport access vlan 20` (ports FastEthernet0/3, 0/4).
  4. Connect Switch1 to Switch2 with a trunk link: `switchport mode trunk`.
  5. Verify STP: `show spanning-tree` (check which switch is the root bridge).
  6. Ping between PCs in the same VLAN (should work) and different VLANs (should fail unless inter-VLAN routing is configured).
- **Why It Matters**: This lab teaches VLAN segmentation and loop prevention, key for enterprise networks and PBQs.

### Quiz
1. What is the purpose of a VLAN?  
   **Answer**: To segment a network logically.
2. Why is STP used?  
   **Answer**: To prevent switching loops in redundant networks.
3. What is the default MTU size?  
   **Answer**: 1500 bytes.

  - **Example**: A hotel provides ‚ÄúGuestWiFi‚Äù with limited access.
- **Authentication**:
  - **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)**: Password-based, suitable for small networks.
  - **802.1X**: Enterprise-grade, uses a RADIUS server.
  - **Example**: 802.1X for secure corporate Wi-Fi with user credentials.
- **Antennas**:
  - **Omnidirectional**: Radiates signal in all directions (e.g., office Wi-Fi).
  - **Directional**: Focused signal for point-to-point links.
- **Access Points (APs)**:
  - Bridge wireless and wired networks.
  - Often powered by PoE (Power over Ethernet).
  - **Example**: Ceiling-mounted AP supporting multiple SSIDs.

### Real-World Example
An office deploys an AP on channel 11 with WPA3 encryption for employees and a guest SSID for visitors, ensuring secure and isolated connectivity.
