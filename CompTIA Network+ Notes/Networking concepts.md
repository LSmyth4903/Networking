## OSI Model üìö
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model standardizes network functions into seven layers, providing a framework for troubleshooting and network design.

### Key Concepts
| **Layer** | **Name**          | **Function**                                                  | **Protocols/Examples**                     | **Example**                     |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 7         | Application       | Provides network services to user applications                | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS                      | Accessing a website (e.g., browsing google.com) |
| 6         | Presentation      | Formats, encrypts, and compresses data                        | SSL, TLS, JPEG                             | Encrypting an email with TLS   |
| 5         | Session           | Manages communication sessions between devices                | NetBIOS, PPTP                              | Maintaining a video call session |
| 4         | Transport         | Ensures reliable data transfer with error checking            | TCP, UDP                                   | Ensuring email delivery via TCP |
| 3         | Network           | Routes data between networks using IP addresses               | IP, ICMP                                   | Routing a packet to a server   |
| 2         | Data Link         | Transfers data between devices using MAC addresses            | Ethernet, MAC addresses                    | Addressing a frame in a LAN    |
| 1         | Physical          | Transmits raw bits over physical media                       | Cables, fiber, wireless                    | Sending signals over an Ethernet cable |

**Details**: Each layer interacts with adjacent layers, building data from the application down to the physical layer for transmission and reversing the process at the destination. For example, sending an email involves creating the message (Layer 7), encrypting it (Layer 6), managing the session (Layer 5), ensuring reliable delivery (Layer 4), routing it (Layer 3), addressing it (Layer 2), and transmitting it (Layer 1).

**Real-World Example**: A postal system analogy: the Physical layer is the delivery truck (transmitting bits), Data Link addresses the envelope (MAC addressing), Network plans the route (IP routing), Transport ensures delivery (TCP reliability), Session manages ongoing correspondence, Presentation translates the letter‚Äôs content, and Application writes the message.

**Mnemonic**: ‚ÄúAll People Seem To Need Data Processing‚Äù (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical).

| **Topology**       | **Description**                              | **Example**                     | **Details**                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Mesh               | All devices interconnected                   | Wireless mesh networks          | High redundancy, complex to manage       |
| Hybrid             | Combines multiple topologies                 | Corporate networks              | Balances cost, performance, and scalability |
| Star               | Central hub connects all devices             | Office LAN with a switch        | Simple, but hub is a single point of failure |
| Spine and Leaf     | Data center design with spine/leaf switches  | Modern data centers             | Scalable, low-latency, high bandwidth    |
| Point-to-Point     | Direct connection between two devices        | Leased line between offices     | Simple, dedicated, low-latency           |
| Three-Tier         | Core, distribution, and access layers        | Enterprise networks             | Hierarchical, scalable, robust           |
| Collapsed Core     | Combines core and distribution layers        | Small business networks         | Cost-effective, simpler than three-tier  |

**Details**: Star topology is common in small networks due to simplicity. Spine-and-leaf is optimized for data centers, offering high bandwidth. Three-tier is used in large enterprises for scalability, while collapsed core suits smaller setups.

**Real-World Example**: An office uses a star topology with a central switch connecting PCs, printers, and servers, simplifying setup but relying on the switch.

**Homelab Activity**: **Simulate Star Topology**
- **Tool**: Cisco Packet Tracer (free at skillsforall.com).
- **Objective**: Build and test a star topology network.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Packet Tracer and add one switch and four PCs.
  2. Connect each PC to the switch via Ethernet (FastEthernet0/1‚Äì0/4).
  3. Assign IPs: PC1 (192.168.1.2/24), PC2 (192.168.1.3/24), PC3 (192.168.1.4/24), PC4 (192.168.1.5/24), all with gateway 192.168.1.1.
  4. Test connectivity by pinging between PCs (e.g., PC1 to PC2).
  5. Save the configuration and note the switch‚Äôs role as the central hub.
  6. Document the setup (e.g., ‚ÄúStar topology with switch, 4 PCs, ping successful‚Äù).
- **Why It Matters**: Demonstrates a common topology, reinforcing network design for exam and real-world scenarios.

## IPv4 Addressing üìç
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to identify devices on a network.

### Key Concepts
- **Public vs. Private**:
  - **Public**: Routable on the internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8, Google‚Äôs DNS).
  - **Private**: Reserved for internal networks per RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
  - **Example**: Home devices use 192.168.1.x with NAT for internet access.
- **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)**:
  - Assigns IPs in 169.254.0.0/16 when DHCP fails.
  - **Example**: A device assigns 169.254.1.1 without a DHCP server.
- **Loopback**:
  - Reserved for testing (127.0.0.1).
  - **Example**: Pinging 127.0.0.1 to verify TCP/IP stack functionality.
- **Subnetting**:
  - **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)**: Allocates variable subnet sizes for efficiency.
  - **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Notation like 192.168.1.0/24 for flexible addressing.
  - **Example**: Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 into /26:
    - /24 = 256 addresses (255.255.255.0).
    - /26 = 64 addresses per subnet (62 usable after reserving network and broadcast).
    - Subnets: 192.168.1.0‚Äì63, 64‚Äì127, 128‚Äì191, 192‚Äì255.
    - **Steps**:
      1. Convert /24 to binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000.
      2. For /26, borrow 2 bits: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000.
      3. Calculate hosts: 2^(32-26) - 2 = 62 usable hosts per subnet.
      4. List ranges: Increment by 64 (e.g., 192.168.1.0, 192.168.1.64).
- **Address Classes**:
  - **Class A**: 1.0.0.0‚Äì126.0.0.0 (mask: 255.0.0.0, 16M hosts).
  - **Class B**: 128.0.0.0‚Äì191.255.0.0 (mask: 255.255.0.0, 65K hosts).
  - **Class C**: 192.0.0.0‚Äì223.255.255.0 (mask: 255.255.255.0, 254 hosts).
  - **Class D**: 224.0.0.0‚Äì239.255.255.255 (multicast).
  - **Class E**: 240.0.0.0‚Äì255.255.255.255 (experimental, reserved).

**Real-World Example**: A home router assigns private IPs (192.168.1.x) via DHCP, using NAT to translate to a public IP for internet access.

**Homelab Activity**: **Practice Subnetting**
- **Tools**: Cisco Packet Tracer (free at skillsforall.com) and subnet calculator (subnet-calculator.com).
- **Objective**: Subnet a network and configure devices.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Packet Tracer and create a network with one router, one switch, and two PCs.
  2. Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 into two /25 networks (128 addresses each):
     - Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0‚Äì127 (mask: 255.255.255.128).
     - Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128‚Äì255 (mask: 255.255.255.128).
  3. Configure PC1: IP 192.168.1.2/25, gateway 192.168.1.1.
  4. Configure PC2: IP 192.168.1.130/25, gateway 192.168.1.129.
  5. Configure router interfaces:
     - GigabitEthernet0/0: `ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.128`, `no shutdown`.
     - GigabitEthernet0/1: `ip address 192.168.1.129 255.255.255.128`, `no shutdown`.
  6. Connect PC1 to GigabitEthernet0/0 and PC2 to GigabitEthernet0/1 via the switch.
  7. Test connectivity with `ping` between PCs (may require inter-VLAN routing configuration).
  8. Document the subnet plan and results.
- **Why It Matters**: Builds subnetting skills, critical for exam PBQs and network design.

**Quiz**:
1. What is a private IP range?  
   **Answer**: 192.168.0.0/16 (or 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12).  
2. How many usable hosts are in a /26 subnet?  
   **Answer**: 62.  
3. What is the purpose of APIPA?  
   **Answer**: Assigns IPs when DHCP fails (169.254.0.0/16).
