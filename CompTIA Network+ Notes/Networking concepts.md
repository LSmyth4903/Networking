## OSI Model üìö
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model standardizes network functions into seven layers, providing a framework for troubleshooting and network design.

### Key Concepts
| **Layer** | **Name**          | **Function**                                                  | **Protocols/Examples**                     | **Example**                     |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 7         | Application       | Provides network services to user applications                | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS                      | Accessing a website (e.g., browsing google.com) |
| 6         | Presentation      | Formats, encrypts, and compresses data                        | SSL, TLS, JPEG                             | Encrypting an email with TLS   |
| 5         | Session           | Manages communication sessions between devices                | NetBIOS, PPTP                              | Maintaining a video call session |
| 4         | Transport         | Ensures reliable data transfer with error checking            | TCP, UDP                                   | Ensuring email delivery via TCP |
| 3         | Network           | Routes data between networks using IP addresses               | IP, ICMP                                   | Routing a packet to a server   |
| 2         | Data Link         | Transfers data between devices using MAC addresses            | Ethernet, MAC addresses                    | Addressing a frame in a LAN    |
| 1         | Physical          | Transmits raw bits over physical media                       | Cables, fiber, wireless                    | Sending signals over an Ethernet cable |

**Details**: Each layer interacts with adjacent layers, building data from the application down to the physical layer for transmission and reversing the process at the destination. For example, sending an email involves creating the message (Layer 7), encrypting it (Layer 6), managing the session (Layer 5), ensuring reliable delivery (Layer 4), routing it (Layer 3), addressing it (Layer 2), and transmitting it (Layer 1).

**Real-World Example**: A postal system analogy: the Physical layer is the delivery truck (transmitting bits), Data Link addresses the envelope (MAC addressing), Network plans the route (IP routing), Transport ensures delivery (TCP reliability), Session manages ongoing correspondence, Presentation translates the letter‚Äôs content, and Application writes the message.

**Mnemonic**: ‚ÄúAll People Seem To Need Data Processing‚Äù (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical).

| **Topology**       | **Description**                              | **Example**                     | **Details**                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Mesh               | All devices interconnected                   | Wireless mesh networks          | High redundancy, complex to manage       |
| Hybrid             | Combines multiple topologies                 | Corporate networks              | Balances cost, performance, and scalability |
| Star               | Central hub connects all devices             | Office LAN with a switch        | Simple, but hub is a single point of failure |
| Spine and Leaf     | Data center design with spine/leaf switches  | Modern data centers             | Scalable, low-latency, high bandwidth    |
| Point-to-Point     | Direct connection between two devices        | Leased line between offices     | Simple, dedicated, low-latency           |
| Three-Tier         | Core, distribution, and access layers        | Enterprise networks             | Hierarchical, scalable, robust           |
| Collapsed Core     | Combines core and distribution layers        | Small business networks         | Cost-effective, simpler than three-tier  |

**Details**: Star topology is common in small networks due to simplicity. Spine-and-leaf is optimized for data centers, offering high bandwidth. Three-tier is used in large enterprises for scalability, while collapsed core suits smaller setups.

**Real-World Example**: An office uses a star topology with a central switch connecting PCs, printers, and servers, simplifying setup but relying on the switch.

**Homelab Activity**: **Simulate Star Topology**
- **Tool**: Cisco Packet Tracer (free at skillsforall.com).

## IP Addressing and Subnetting üìç
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to identify devices on a network. Subnetting divides networks into smaller segments for efficiency and management.

### Key Concepts
- **Public vs. Private**:
  - **Public**: Routable on the internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8, Google‚Äôs DNS).
  - **Private**: Reserved for internal networks per RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
  - **Example**: Home devices use 192.168.1.x with NAT for internet access.
- **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)**:
  - Assigns IPs in 169.254.0.0/16 when DHCP fails.
  - **Example**: A device assigns 169.254.1.1 without a DHCP server.
- **Loopback**:
  - Reserved for testing (127.0.0.1).
  - **Example**: Pinging 127.0.0.1 to verify TCP/IP stack functionality.
- **Address Classes**:
  | **Class** | **IP Range**                | **Default Mask** | **Hosts**         | **Use Case**                     |
  |-----------|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
  | Class A   | 1.0.0.0‚Äì126.0.0.0          | 255.0.0.0 (/8)   | 16,777,216 (16M)  | Large networks (e.g., ISPs)      |
  | Class B   | 128.0.0.0‚Äì191.255.0.0      | 255.255.0.0 (/16)| 65,536 (65K)      | Medium networks (e.g., universities) |
  | Class C   | 192.0.0.0‚Äì223.255.255.0    | 255.255.255.0 (/24)| 256 (254 usable)| Small networks (e.g., offices)   |
  | Class D   | 224.0.0.0‚Äì239.255.255.255  | N/A              | N/A               | Multicast (e.g., video streaming)|
  | Class E   | 240.0.0.0‚Äì255.255.255.255  | N/A              | N/A               | Experimental, reserved           |
  - **Details**: Classes A, B, and C are used for unicast addressing, with default masks defining network and host portions. Class D is reserved for multicast, and Class E for experimental purposes.
- **Subnetting**:
  - **Purpose**: Divides a network into smaller subnets to reduce congestion, enhance security, and optimize IP allocation.
  - **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)**: Allocates variable subnet sizes for efficiency.
  - **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Notation like 192.168.1.0/24 for flexible addressing.
  - **Key Terms**:
    - **Subnet Mask**: Separates network and host portions (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
    - **Network Address**: First address in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0).
    - **Broadcast Address**: Last address in a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.255).
    - **Usable Hosts**: Total addresses minus network and broadcast (e.g., 254 for /24).
  - **Subnetting Process**:
    1. Determine requirements (subnets and hosts needed).
    2. Calculate new subnet mask by borrowing bits from the host portion.
    3. Find increment (256 - subnet mask value in the interesting octet).
    4. List subnet ranges (network, usable hosts, broadcast).
  - **Example (192.168.1.0/26)**:
    - Mask: 255.255.255.192.
    - Increment: 256 - 192 = 64.
    - Subnets: 192.168.1.0, 192.168.1.64, 192.168.1.128, 192.168.1.192.
    - Host range for 192.168.1.0/26: 192.168.1.1‚Äì192.168.1.62.
    - Broadcast: 192.168.1.63.
    - Usable hosts: 2^(32-26) - 2 = 62.
  - **VLSM Example**:
    - From 192.168.1.0/24, allocate /26 (60 hosts), /27 (30 hosts), /30 (2 hosts) to avoid IP waste.
  - **Common Subnet Masks**:
    | CIDR | Subnet Mask       | Hosts (Usable) | Increment | Subnets |
    |------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|---------|
    | /24  | 255.255.255.0     | 256 (254)      | 256       | 1       |
    | /25  | 255.255.255.128   | 128 (126)      | 128       | 2       |
    | /26  | 255.255.255.192   | 64 (62)        | 64        | 4       |
    | /27  | 255.255.255.224   | 32 (30)        | 32        | 8       |
    | /28  | 255.255.255.240   | 16 (14)        | 16        | 16      |
    | /29  | 255.255.255.248   | 8 (6)          | 8         | 32      |
    | /30  | 255.255.255.252   | 4 (2)          | 4         | 64      |
  - **Key Formulas**:
    - Subnets: 2^(borrowed bits).
    - Hosts per subnet: 2^(host bits) - 2.
    - Increment: 256 - (subnet mask value in interesting octet).
- **Binary Conversion**:
  - IP addresses and subnet masks are 32-bit binary numbers, divided into four 8-bit octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1 = 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001).
  - **Decimal to Binary**: Divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly, recording remainders from bottom to top. Pad with leading zeros to reach 8 bits per octet.
    - **Example (192)**: 192 √∑ 2 = 96 (remainder 0), 96 √∑ 2 = 48 (0), 48 √∑ 2 = 24 (0), 24 √∑ 2 = 12 (0), 12 √∑ 2 = 6 (0), 6 √∑ 2 = 3 (0), 3 √∑ 2 = 1 (1), 1 √∑ 2 = 0 (1). Result: 11000000.
    - **Example (1)**: 1 √∑ 2 = 0 (remainder 1). Pad with zeros: 00000001.
  - **Binary to Decimal**: Multiply each bit by its positional value (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) and sum the results.
    - **Example (11000000)**: 1√ó128 + 1√ó64 + 0√ó32 + 0√ó16 + 0√ó8 + 0√ó4 + 0√ó2 + 0√ó1 = 128 + 64 = 192.
    - **Example (10101000)**: 1√ó128 + 0√ó64 + 1√ó32 + 0√ó16 + 1√ó8 + 0√ó4 + 0√ó2 + 0√ó1 = 128 + 32 + 8 = 168.
  - **Subnet Mask Example**: A /24 mask (255.255.255.0) in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 (24 ones, 8 zeros). Borrowing 2 bits for /26 results in 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 (255.255.255.192).
  - **Why It Matters**: Binary conversion is essential for subnetting, as it allows precise calculation of network and host portions, especially when borrowing bits for custom subnets.

**Real-World Example**: A home router assigns private IPs (192.168.1.x) via DHCP, using NAT to translate to a public IP for internet access. A company subnets 192.168.1.0/24 into /27 networks for departments to isolate traffic.

**Homelab Activity**: **Practice Subnetting**
- **Tools**: Cisco Packet Tracer (free at skillsforall.com) and subnet calculator (subnet-calculator.com).
- **Objective**: Subnet a network and configure devices.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open Packet Tracer and create a network with one router, one switch, and two PCs.
  2. Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 into four /26 networks:
     - Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0‚Äì63 (mask: 255.255.255.192).
     - Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64‚Äì127 (mask: 255.255.255.192).
     - Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128‚Äì191 (mask: 255.255.255.192).
     - Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192‚Äì255 (mask: 255.255.255.192).
  3. Configure PC1: IP 192.168.1.2/26, gateway 192.168.1.1.
  4. Configure PC2: IP 192.168.1.66/26, gateway 192.168.1.65.
  5. Configure router interfaces:
     - GigabitEthernet0/0: `ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192`, `no shutdown`.
     - GigabitEthernet0/1: `ip address 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.192`, `no shutdown`.
  6. Connect PC1 to GigabitEthernet0/0 and PC2 to GigabitEthernet0/1 via the switch.
  7. Test connectivity with `ping` between PCs (may require inter-VLAN routing configuration).
  8. Document the subnet plan and results.
- **Why It Matters**: Builds subnetting skills, critical for exam PBQs and network design, reinforced by the YouTube subnetting course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WfiTHiU4x8&list=PLIhvC56v63IKrRHh3gvZZBAGvsvOhwrRF).

[Translated to 203.0.113.1:Port1] [Translated to 203.0.113.1:Port2]
```
- **Explanation**: Devices in the LAN use private IPs (192.168.1.2/24 and 192.168.1.3/24). The router performs NAT, translating these private IPs to a single public IP (203.0.113.1) with unique port numbers (e.g., Port1, Port2) to track sessions. This allows multiple devices to share one public IP for internet access, conserving public IP addresses and enhancing security by hiding internal IPs.

**Quiz**:
1. What is a private IP range?  
   **Answer**: 192.168.0.0/16 (or 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12).  
2. How many usable hosts are in a /26 subnet?  
   **Answer**: 62.  
3. What is the purpose of APIPA?  
   **Answer**: Assigns IPs when DHCP fails (169.254.0.0/16).  
4. How many subnets does a /27 create from a /24 network?  
   **Answer**: 8 (2^3).  
5. What is the increment for a /25 subnet?  
   **Answer**: 128 (256 - 128).
