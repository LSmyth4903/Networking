# Networking Glossary – Lee Smyth

---

## Network  
A group of connected devices (computers, phones, printers, etc.) that can communicate and share resources like files, internet, or printers.

---

## Internet  
A massive network of networks that allows devices around the world to communicate. It uses a standardized set of protocols (like TCP/IP) to transfer data.

---

## Router  
A device that connects your local network (like your home Wi-Fi) to the internet. It routes data between your devices and external networks. Often includes a built-in switch and wireless access point.

---

## Switch  
A device that connects multiple devices within a local network and forwards data only to the specific device it’s meant for. More efficient than a hub.

---

## Port  
A numbered “door” on a device used to identify specific services or apps.  
Examples:  
- **Port 80** – HTTP (web traffic)  
- **Port 443** – HTTPS (secure web)  
- **Port 22** – SSH (remote login)  
- **Port 53** – DNS (name lookup)

---

## IP Address  
A unique identifier for a device on a network.  
- **IPv4**: 32-bit (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)  
- **IPv6**: 128-bit (e.g., `2001:0db8::7334`)

---

## Private IP Address  
IP addresses used **inside** local networks only. Not routable on the internet.  
Examples:  
- `192.168.x.x`  
- `10.x.x.x`  
- `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`

---

## Public IP Address  
Assigned by your ISP and used to access the internet. Routers share this public IP with internal devices using NAT.

---

## NAT (Network Address Translation)  
A method used by routers to rewrite private IP addresses into a single public IP address. Allows multiple devices to share one internet-facing IP.

---

## MAC Address  
A unique identifier assigned to a network device’s hardware.  
Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`  
Used **within a LAN**, doesn’t change like IP addresses can.

---

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)  
Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network so you don’t have to configure them manually.

---

## DNS (Domain Name System)  
Translates domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses (`8.8.8.8`). Like a phone book for the internet.

---

## Firewall  
A network security system that controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules. Can block or allow certain ports, IPs, or protocols.

---

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  
A connection-oriented protocol. Ensures data is delivered completely and in the correct order.  
- Reliable  
- Slower  
- Used for: web browsing, file transfers

---

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)  
A connectionless protocol. Faster but less reliable—data can arrive out of order or get lost.  
- Unreliable  
- Fast  
- Used for: video streaming, gaming, DNS

---

## LAN (Local Area Network)  
A small network limited to a geographic area like a house, office, or campus.

---

## WAN (Wide Area Network)  
A large network that spans geographic locations—includes the internet.

---

## Latency  
The time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to destination. Measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower = better.

---

## Bandwidth  
The maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a given time. Measured in Mbps or Gbps.

---

## Ping  
A command that checks if a host is reachable and measures how long it takes to respond.

---

## Traceroute / Tracert  
A tool that shows each “hop” data takes to reach its destination. Helps identify where delays or drops occur.

---

## OSI Model (7 Layers)  
A conceptual framework used to understand network interactions.

| Layer | Name         | Description / Examples             |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application  | What the user interacts with (HTTP, FTP) |
| 6     | Presentation | Translates data (encryption, SSL)  |
| 5     | Session      | Maintains connections (RPC, NetBIOS) |
| 4     | Transport    | Reliable delivery (TCP, UDP)       |
| 3     | Network      | Routing (IP, ICMP)                 |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC addressing (Ethernet)          |
| 1     | Physical     | Cables, Wi-Fi signals              |

**Mnemonic:** "All People Seem To Need Data Processing"

## Port Forwarding  
A router configuration that forwards a request from a public IP and port to a private IP and port inside the network. Used to host game servers, websites, etc.

---

## IPv4 vs IPv6  
- **IPv4**: 4.3 billion addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)  
- **IPv6**: 340 undecillion addresses (e.g., `2001:db8::1`)
